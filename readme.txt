Technology Stack
This project is built primarily with front-end web technologies and a basic PHP script for the contact form.

HTML: Provides the structure for all web pages.
CSS: Styles the website for an appealing and responsive design.
JavaScript: Adds interactive functionality to the site, such as the login/sign-up toggle.
PHP: A server-side script is used to process the contact form submissions.
Bootstrap: The website's design is based on the "Impact" template, which uses Bootstrap for its layout and components. The current version is 1.2.0, with Bootstrap version 5.2.3.
Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/dharam2003/submitmate.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd submitmate
Open the index.html file in your web browser to view the website.
Note: The contact.php script requires a local server environment (such as XAMPP, MAMP, or WAMP) to function properly.

Project Status and Future Updates
This project is currently a front-end web template with limited backend functionality. While the user interface is well-defined, several key features are not yet fully implemented.

Areas for Improvement and Future Updates
Full Backend Integration: Implement a robust backend system to handle user authentication, file uploads, and data storage. The current login and registration forms are for display only and do not connect to a database.
Functional Submissions Dashboard: The submission.html page is a placeholder. Future updates should connect this page to a database to display actual submissions, user information, and allow administrators to manage and review files.
Contact Form Configuration: The contact.php script's receiving email address is a placeholder (contact@example.com) and must be updated to a valid email to function correctly.
Portfolio Section: The website includes a commented-out "Portfolio" section that could be developed to showcase project examples or user success stories.
Team Page: The "Our Team" section currently only displays one team member. This could be expanded to include other project contributors.
