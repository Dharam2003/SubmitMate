## Technology Stack

This project is built primarily with front-end web technologies and a basic PHP script for the contact form.

* **HTML**: Provides the structure for all web pages.
* **CSS**: Styles the website for an appealing and responsive design.
* **JavaScript**: Adds interactive functionality to the site, such as the login/sign-up toggle.
* **PHP**: A server-side script is used to process the contact form submissions.
* **Bootstrap**: The website's design is based on the "Impact" template, which uses Bootstrap for its layout and components. The current version is 1.2.0, with Bootstrap version 5.2.3.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:
    `git clone https://github.com/dharam2003/submitmate.git`
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    `cd submitmate`
3.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the website.

_Note: The `contact.php` script requires a local server environment (such as XAMPP, MAMP, or WAMP) to function properly._

## Project Status and Future Updates

This project is currently a front-end web template with limited backend functionality. While the user interface is well-defined, several key features are not yet fully implemented.

### Areas for Improvement and Future Updates

* **Full Backend Integration**: Implement a robust backend system to handle user authentication, file uploads, and data storage. The current login and registration forms are for display only and do not connect to a database.
* **Functional Submissions Dashboard**: The `submission.html` page is a placeholder. Future updates should connect this page to a database to display actual submissions, user information, and allow administrators to manage and review files.
* **Contact Form Configuration**: The `contact.php` script's receiving email address is a placeholder (`contact@example.com`) and must be updated to a valid email to function correctly.
* **Portfolio Section**: The website includes a commented-out "Portfolio" section that could be developed to showcase project examples or user success stories.
* **Team Page**: The "Our Team" section currently only displays one team member. This could be expanded to include other project contributors.
